# Calculator App 🧮

A simple command-line calculator built with Python. This app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations between two numbers.

## 🚀 Features

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Floor Division (`//`)
- Modulus (`%`)
- Exponentiation (`**`)
- Handles division by zero gracefully

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. The program welcomes the user.
2. It prompts for:
   - The first number (`num1`)
   - The second number (`num2`)
   - The operation to perform (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, etc.)
3. It performs the operation and prints the result.

## 💡 Example

```bash
Welcome to the Calculator App
Enter the first Number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Input the operation : /
2.0
